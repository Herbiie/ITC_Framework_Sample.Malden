a. Concept Of Operations<br/>
1 Platoon will launch a platoon attack on the tower in order to secure it. The platoon will then occupy the tower and adjacent building and began a delaying action. We will maintain a route of withdrawal to allow us to fall back in good order.<br/>

Commander's intent is to destroy the enemy through a platoon attack.<br/>
<br/>
c. Desired End State<br/>
1 Platoon conducting delaying action from the tower.<br/>
<br/>
d. Scheme of Manouevre<br/>
2 Section will provide fire support on to the tower while 3 section will block enemy reinforcements from moving in from the North East. Once these positions are established, 1 section will assault and clear the tower and the barracks building. The platoon will then re-org at the tower and begin our delaying action.<br/>
<br/>
e. Section Missions<br/>
1 Section - You are to DESTROY the enemy within the tower in order to allow us to occupy the position. You are the main effort.<br/>
2 Section - You are to FIX the enemy in the tower in order to allow 1 Section to assault.<br/>
3 Section - You are to BLOCK enemy forces from reinforcing from the North East in order to PROTECT our right flank.<br/>
